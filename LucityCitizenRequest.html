<!-- Welcome to the LucityCitizenRequest html file! The comments throughout should help you learn how to use and modify this file to fit your desire. As a top level note, it must be said that all ids are VERY SPECIFIC
and they are ALL CASE SENSITIVE. DO NOT MODIFY the ids of anything that does not need to be changed. The casing of each id is not consistent throughout the document, THIS IS BY DESIGN. Additionally, all classes are
case specific, classes must be cased as provided or they WILL NOT WORK. When changing the ids of the inputs and changing their labels, be sure to use the casing provided by Lucity so that it matches the RESTAPI. If
an id is input but it is not working as expected, check the casing, it must match EXACTLY -->
